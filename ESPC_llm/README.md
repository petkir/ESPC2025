Join us for an insightful session where we demonstrate how to leverage a local Large Language Model (LLM) to interact seamlessly with both Microsoft 365 and on-premise data. As C# enthusiasts, we'll show you how to connect your local AI to local data and also how to consume data from M365 services, such as calendars, to enhance your productivity and provide a unique company experience. This end-to-end sample will showcase practical applications and provide you with the tools to integrate AI into your organization's data ecosystem securely. Don't miss this opportunity to learn a 127.0.0.1 way to manage and utilize your data!
